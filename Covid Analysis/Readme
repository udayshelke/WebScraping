Web Scraping and Basic Data Analysis on COVID Data using Python
A basic project in Python and Jupyter Notebook, to scrape and analyse some Coronavirus-related data.

app.py is the Python source code for scraping data from worldometers.info. It uses BeautifulSoup library to parse the data from the website. The resultant data is stored in csv format with the file name corona.csv.

Basic data analysis is done on the corona.csv file using Jupyter Notebook.(data_processing.ipynb).
The data is checked, and duplicate and unnecessary rows are removed. Column data types are changed to more suitable formats. Graphical representation of the data is demonstrated.
